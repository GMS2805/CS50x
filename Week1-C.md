• 1h 57min point felt pretty alien/unknown to me. Need to slow down, take notes. started the re-watch.
• yesterday, i spent time on the problem0 (week 0 scratch problem) it is still ongoing. needs more work. maybe i should focus on one thing at a time, the lecture or the problem/week0 scratch game i am making.
